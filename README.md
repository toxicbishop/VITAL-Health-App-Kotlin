## Architecture

The app is built with a separated architecture that isolates UI logic from Data handling, improving testability and code maintainability:

- **UI Layer**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, consisting of `Screens` that consume states exposed by scoped `ViewModels`.
- **Data Layer**: Centralized through a `HealthRepository` that mediates between the **Local DB** (Room SQLite for offline-first capabilities) and the **Remote API** (Supabase for cloud sync and authentication).
- **DI Layer**: Dagger Hilt manages application-wide dependencies such as database instances and Auth managers.
- **Entry Point**: `MainActivity` serves as the host for Compose Navigation routing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Iguana or newer
- JDK 17+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Enable **Email Auth** in Authentication settings
3. Create a `health_logs` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE health_logs (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     "userId" UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     "logType" TEXT NOT NULL,
     value TEXT NOT NULL,
     unit TEXT NOT NULL,
     notes TEXT,
     timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
     "isSynced" BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
   );
   ALTER TABLE health_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY "owner read"   ON health_logs FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = "userId");
   CREATE POLICY "owner insert" ON health_logs FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = "userId");
   CREATE POLICY "owner update" ON health_logs FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = "userId");
   CREATE POLICY "owner delete" ON health_logs FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = "userId");
   ```
4. Create an `avatars` storage bucket. Keep it **private** and add RLS policies that allow users to read/write only paths prefixed with their own `auth.uid()`.

### Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the project root and fill in `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
2. For release builds, copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill in your keystore credentials, **or** set `VITAL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `VITAL_KEY_ALIAS`, `VITAL_KEY_PASSWORD` as environment variables. Both files are gitignored.

> **Never commit production secrets, keystores, or their passwords to version control.**

### Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or simply click **Run** (Shift+F10) in Android Studio.

---

## Design

- **Light Mode**: Warm cream (`#F5F3EC`) background with black accents and tan buttons
- **Dark Mode**: Espresso charcoal (`#1A1714`) with warm off-white text — no jarring blues
- **Typography**: Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text
- **Iconography**: Custom adaptive vector launcher icon

---

## Testing Note

When repeatedly signing up during testing, you may hit Supabase's **Email Rate Limit**. To work around this:

- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Rate Limits and increase temporarily
- Or log in with pre-created accounts from the Supabase Dashboard
